## Privacy  

This plugin complies with Moodle's privacy policies. It does not store personal data on Moodle but communicates with the Alphabees backend. For more information, refer to the `PRIVACY.md` file.

## License  

This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. For more details, see the `LICENSE` file included in the repository.  

## Proprietary Components

The Alphabees Chat Widget is a proprietary, externally hosted JavaScript file dynamically loaded into Moodle via this plugin.
To ensure consistency and efficiency, the widget is centrally managed and versioned on our servers. This approach reduces maintenance overhead across plugins for different LMS platforms, enabling seamless updates and a consistent user experience.
As part of our business model, the chat widget generates revenue to finance ongoing operations and development. For this reason, it is not open-source, though the Moodle plugin code remains fully open-source and compliant with Moodle's development standards.
